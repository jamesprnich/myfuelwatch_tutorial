# myFuelwatch - What are we creating?

Initially we are creating a Python script that will take fuel price information from the [Fuelwatch](https://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au) website, manipulate it \(sort, filter etc\)and then display the results as a webpage \(html file\). We will progressively improve each version with more features and ultimately make a web application.

### myFuelwatch v1

* Connect to the Fuelwatch API
* Download data from the Fuelwatch API
* Print some of the data which was downloaded so it is easy to read

### myFuelwatch v2

* Sorting fuel data

### myFuelwatch v3

* Get fuel data for multiple fuel types

### myFuelwatch v4

* Output results to HTML and make it look better

### myFuelwatch v5

* TBA

**Next Up:   
**We look at the Fuelwatch [API](the-basics.md#api)
